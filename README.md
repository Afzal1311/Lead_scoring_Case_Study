# Lead_Scoring_Case_Study

Hello, I'm Afzal Ahmad, currently employed as an engineer at Quest Global. I am actively engaged in a data science program at IIIT-B. The focus of our case study is on a company, referred to as X, that seeks insights into the conversion rate of students who transition from being leads to successfully enrolling. The company desires a machine learning program to assess and understand the conversion rates, identifying areas of strength and weakness. This program aims to pinpoint why certain individuals may not be converting and where the company should concentrate its efforts for improvement. Join us on this exploration into enhancing conversion strategies through data-driven insights.
